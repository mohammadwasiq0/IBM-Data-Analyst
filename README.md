# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

In this Capstone Project, as a newly hired Data Analyst, I'll delve into the dynamic world of IT skill trends. Tasked with aiding our organization's foresight in tech evolution, 
I'll collect and analyze data from job postings, training portals, and surveys. Our focus will be on discerning the most sought-after programming languages, database skills, and IDEs. 
Employing diverse data collection methods, including web scraping and API access, I'll wrangle the data and apply statistical techniques for analysis. Ultimately, leveraging IBM Cognos Analytics, 
I'll craft insightful dashboards and deliver a compelling presentation, showcasing our findings on emerging IT skills.





### Scenario 1
In this scenario, I collected job opening data for technologies like Java, Python, MySQL, C++, and C# using the GitHub Jobs API.
This included data collection through APIs and also involved web scraping techniques to gather additional relevant information. 
Following data collection, I explored the datasets to understand their structure and contents, facilitating further analysis.

### Scenario 2

Data Wrangling techniques will be used to perform the following tasks:

Data wrangling techniques will be utilized to achieve the following tasks: Identifying duplicate rows in the dataset, 
removing duplicate rows from the dataframe, determining the number of missing values for all columns, 
obtaining the value counts for the "Employment" column, and normalizing the data using two existing columns.

### Scenario 3

In this assignment, I will plot a distribution curve and histogram, find the median and outliers of particular columns, 
compute the interquartile range, determine the upper and lower bounds, and explore correlations between numerical columns. 
Additionally, you will create a new dataframe.

### Scenario 4

In this assignment, you'll demonstrate your visualization skills using the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 dataset.
You'll create various plots including histograms, scatter plots, bubble plots, box plots, pie charts, bar charts, 
and stacked charts to illustrate the distribution, relationships, and counts of the data.

### Scenario 5

In this assignment, I developed three dashboard tabs using survey data with IBM Cognos Analytics. The first tab focused on current technology usage, 
displaying top languages and databases worked with, platforms used, and preferred web frameworks. The second tab highlighted future technology trends, 
showcasing desired languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks. The third tab delved into demographics, presenting respondent counts by gender
, country, age, and gender categorized by education level. Each visualization utilized appropriate chart types and features to provide insights into technology trends and demographics.

### Scenario 6

For your final assignment you will create a presentation based on the analysis of your data conducted in previous modules. 
Your presentation will develop into a story of your analysis that should be compelling and easy to understand. 
A PowerPoint template has been provided to get you started however you are free to add additional slides, charts and tables.
